Interactive problem solver. A React app which lets you try out different
sequences of moves for this problem.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The solution to my part 2:

## Running it

In the project directory, run:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can click on the coloured squares and move them around. It keeps track of
your score, and you can jump to different points in your history and make
different moves.

It *does not* enforce the rules of the puzzle! So you have to understand them
yourself and make sure you don't make any invalid moves!
